# Cullbot

Cullbot delivers important news, filtering the rest.

# How it works

* You can upvote the news, so that it reaches more people.

* Cullbot counts Alice's link as 1 vote.
* Bob has "min votes" set at 1, so he does receive the news.
* Sam has "min votes" set at 2, so he doesn't receive the news.
* Bob upvotes the curfew announcement, because he thinks it's important.
* Sam receives
